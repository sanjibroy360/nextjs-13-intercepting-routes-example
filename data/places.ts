    description: `Another relic of the British Raj in India, the Victoria Memorial is located in the heart of Kolkata, in West Bengal. This white marbled opulent structure was built in memory of Queen Victoria to celebrate her 25 years of rule over India and is almost a replica of the Victoria Memorial in London. Victoria Memorial is an iconic structure that is synonymous with the city of joy!

    The memorial is surrounded by a lush green and well-maintained garden, which spreads over 64 acres and has numerous statues and sculptures in it. A sixteen-foot tall bronze statue of victory, mounted on ball bearings at the top of the memorial, serves to heighten the overall appeal and grandeur of the entire complex. Victoria Memorial is breathtaking and marvellous, especially at night, when it is illuminated. The Sound and Light shows that take place in the evening are an added delight, and a must watch. All in all, the place is a must visit for people to wish to relive the essence of the Victorian era in the modern day world. 
    
    The reason behind the building of a monument of this grand a scale is indeed an interesting one. This stunning creation is the brainchild of Lord Curzon and was created to commemorate the twenty-fifth-year reign of the Queen over India. The Queen had become the figure head of India after the Revolt of 1857 and successfully ruled over the country until her death in 1901. Lord Curzon wanted that the monument that would be dedicated to her should be stately, spacious and large, with a beautiful garden. In fact, the funds for the construction of the Victoria memorial were raised from the people of India. A sum of 5 lakh rupees was raised, and the result is this awe-striking monument, that is a literal feast for the eyes. King George V and the Prince of Whales laid down the foundation stone for the memorial in 1906, and the memorial was finally opened to the general public in 1921.`,

The spot is where the toes of Sati's right foot fell during Shiva's Tandava dance. It is said that Kalighat was where Chowranga Giri, a Dasanami monk, worshipped Ma Kali with great austerity and has thus been known as a religious centre for Ma Kali worship for centuries. This 200-year-old temple embodies the principle that only divine knowledge can subsume sodomized ego, akin to an Asura. This transcendence will lead to moksha, as Ma Kali guides all through their devoted worship of her.`,

    name: "St. Paul Cathedral",
    description: `Located in the heart of the City of Joy - Kolkata, St Paul's is an Anglican cathedral that operates under CNI – Church of North India. It is a must-visit for those who seek enriching historical and architectural pleasure on their vacation trips. In the heart of the city, this colossal structure reminds you of the colonial times and takes you down the memory lane. Travellers keep this among the top few must-visit places when they come to Kolkata. It looks most beautiful during the Christmas holidays, when the cathedral, the garden around it as well as the surrounding streets are all bathed in light and festivities.

    Primarily built to accommodate the ever-increasing Christian community in Calcutta, it is the first Episcopalian church in Asia. The building follows Indo-Gothic style and its structure is complete with a cascading white edifice, towering spire and colourful tinted windows. Inside, it has a huge nave, majestic altar and chancel, along with carvings and paintings depicting great moments and events of Christian history. The cathedral complex also houses several memorabilia of past congregants and a library where books as old as the church's foundation time still exist donated by founding member Bishop Wilson.

    St. Paul's Cathedral's cornerstone was first laid down in 183 and took modeled long years to complete its colossal structure. The original church was built to replace St. John's Church as the major temple of worship of the Christian community of Calcutta, which was crossing 4,000 in number and becoming impossible to fit in just one church. Even though discussions and proposals regarding St Paul's Cathedral were first observed way back in 1819, during the tenure of Francis Rawdon-Hastings, the then Governor General of Bengal, it was not until 1832 that the project was finally undertaken under Bishop Daniel Wilson.

    The construction of St Paul's Cathedral was orchestrated mainly by Bishop Wilson, designed by Major William Nairn Forbes and architected by C.K. Robinson. The looming tower, spire, and altar was greatly influenced by and partially modelled upon the Norwich Cathedral of the Holy and Undivided Trinity. The construction took precisely eight years from laying cornerstone on October 8, 1839, to the consecration ceremony on October 8, 1847. To mark the consecration of the church, the Empress of British Empire Queen Victoria had sent ten pieces of silver-gilt plates as a gift of honor.

    After Calcutta suffered an earthquake in 1934, the church was revamped for the second time, the first one being after 1897's earthquake. In the natural disaster, the church's previous tower collapsed and thus it was rebuilt modeled on the central Bell Harry Tower of Canterbury Cathedral. After its completion, St Paul's was announced as the new cathedral of Calcutta.
